gqrx-scanner is a frequency scanner written in C that uses gqrx remote
protocol to perform a fast scan of the band. It can be used in
conjunction with the gqrx bookmarks (--mode bookmark) to look for the
already stored frequencies or, in a free sweep scan mode (--mode sweep),
to explore the band within a specified frequency range (--min, --max
options).
