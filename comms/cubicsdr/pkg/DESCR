CubicSDR is a cross-platform Software-Defined Radio application which
allows you to navigate the radio spectrum and demodulate any signals you
might discover. It currently includes several common analog demodulation
schemes such as AM and FM and will support digital modes in the future.
Many digital decoding applications are available now that can use the
analog outputs to process digital signals by "piping" the data from
CubicSDR to another program using software like Soundflower, Jack Audio
or VBCable.

CubicSDR supports the readily-available RTL-SDR which is an inexpensive
SDR device that can be purchased online. Additionally CubicSDR now
includes support for SDRPlay, HackRF, BladeRF, AirSpy, NetSDR+, Red
Pitaya, Audio Devices (some platform specific at the moment) or any
other device with an available SoapySDR support module.
