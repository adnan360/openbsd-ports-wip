binutils-future
===============
binutils-future is a daily snapshot of the tip of the GNU Binutils
development tree.

GNU gold, installed as ld in this package, is taken from the most recent
binutils release, as there are too many necessary patches for it to be
upstreamed.

You should add ${TRUEPREFIX}/gnu/bin to your $PATH.
