binutils-future is an unmodified build of the GNU Binutils, with the
exception of minor modifications for building and testing purposes,
taken from the tip of the development tree.

GNU gold, installed as ld in this package, is taken from the most recent
binutils release, as there are too many necessary patches for it to be
upstreamed.
