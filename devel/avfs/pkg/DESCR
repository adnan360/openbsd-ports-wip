AVFS is a virtual file system layer for transparently accessing the
content of archives and remote directories just like local files.
Currently it can natively access tar, rar, zip, ar, gzip, bzip2, ftp,
http, dav, and some others.

AVFS also supports extfs, the same extensible interface as known from
Midnight Commander, so AVFS can be extended to support new file systems
easily. Support for debian archives, rpm archives, iso9660 images, patch
files and other archives like lha, arj or cpio is available.

AVFS can be used with FUSE to enable access to archives from any
application. AVFS can also be used as a stand-alone shared library if
FUSE is not available or unwanted.
