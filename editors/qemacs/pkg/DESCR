  features.

  Unicode bidi algorithm. Arabic and Indic scripts handling.
* WYSIWYG HTML/XML/CSS2 mode graphical editing. Also supports lynx like
  rendering on VT100 terminals.
* Input methods for most languages, including Chinese (input methods
  come from the Yudit editor).
* Hexadecimal editing mode with insertion and block commands. Unicode
  hexa editing of UTF8 files also supported.
* X11 support. Support multiple proportionnal fonts at the same time (as
  XEmacs). X Input methods supported. Xft extension supported for anti
  aliased font display.
