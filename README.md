STEAL THESE PORTS
=================
These are some work-in-progress ports I'm working on. They're here so that I
(and you) can easily manage new ports that I haven't submitted yet. Ports
here can be at any point along the development path, so please look at a port
before blindly issuing `make install`.

Steal them. Run them on your machine. Submit them to ports@. This repository
should always be as empty as possible.
