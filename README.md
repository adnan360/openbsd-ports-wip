OpenBSD Ports WIP
=================
These are some work-in-progress ports I'm working on. They're here so that I
(and you) can easily manage new ports that I haven't submitted yet. Ports
here can be at any point along the development path, so please look at a port
before blindly issuing `make install`.

You are free to use these ports on your own machine, of course. I am hesitant
to allow others to directly commit here (you should just send stuff to ports@
or to https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip if you really want it in a
work-in-progress repo) but I will take pull requests or emails.

I am also very willing to let people take MAINTAINER of these ports and send
them to ports@. Please email me and ask first, though.
