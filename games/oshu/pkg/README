oshu
====
To play with oshu you need osu! beatmaps. oshu can only work with
Standard beatmaps.

You can download them from the official site
https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets
if you already have an osu! account otherwise download them from
https://bloodcat.com/osu
and select "Standard" in the Mode section of the search filter.

The file downloaded has an osz extension but it's a ZIP file in disguise
so you can extract it with unzip (it's recommended to put each osz file
in its own directory):
$ mkdir song-name && cd song-name
$ mv $HOME/Downloads/file.osz .
$ unzip file.osz

After that you can play an osu! beatmap with:
$ oshu /path/to/your/beatmap.osu

To change the resolution you can set OSHU_WINDOW_SIZE to your monitor
resolution or resize the window manually:
$ export OSHU_WINDOW_SIZE=1920x1080

For more information about the parameters, controls, etc., read oshu(1).
