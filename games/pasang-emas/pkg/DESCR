Pasang is a traditional game of Brunei.

In this game, black and white tokens are arranged on a playing board,
forming a pattern. There is a catalogue of more than 30 different
patterns. Many of these patterns resemble embroideries commonly seen on
kain songket or kain tenun, Brunei's traditional cloth.

Two players take turns capturing these tokens, scoring 1 point for each
black token and 2 points for each white one. The game ends when the
board is empty, or when a player runs out of moves.

Pasang is commonly played during celebrations of royal weddings and the
annual birthday festival of the Sultan of Brunei.
