DF-SHOW (Directory File Show) is a Unix-like rewrite of some of the
applications from Larry Kroeker's DF-EDIT (Directory File Editor) for
MS-DOS and PC-DOS systems, based on the Version 2.3d release from 1986.

The show application lets users view the names of files and directories
on a disk with information about the files. Files can be copied, moved,
viewed, and edited (in your system's default editor). The application is
run using the show command. The output is similar to the ls command. A
file view is also included which can be invoked using the sf command.
