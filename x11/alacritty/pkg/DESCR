Alacritty is a cross platform, GPU accelerated terminal emulator with a strong
focus on simplicity and performance.
It provides sane choices for defaults and requires no additional setup. 
However, it does allow configuration of many aspects of the terminal.

The software is considered to be at a beta level of readiness, there are a few
missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as a daily
driver.
